# Changelog - SadhanaGPT Backend

## 2026-10-04, 12:50 PM IST - Fix

- **Developer**: Manvatar Prabhu Ji
- **What changed**: When a counsellor allots a marking scheme to a group or sub-group (new scheme, scheme edited, rules saved, or scheme removed so students go back to the default), today's already-saved entries of the affected students are now recalculated with the scheme that applies to them, so the new scheme counts straight away. Earlier days are not changed. If the new scheme has no rule for an activity, the default scheme's rule is used for that activity only. If the recalculation fails, the scheme still saves and the problem is written to the server log. Saving waits at most about 8 seconds for the recalculation (very large groups finish in the background), and the built-in default scheme is never recalculated this way.
- **Files touched**: `SadhanaGPT/Controllers/Marking Rules/recalculateMarks.js` (new), `SadhanaGPT/Controllers/Marking Rules/MarkingController.js`, `CHANGELOG.md`
- **Frontend**: no change needed. No database structure change.

## 2026-10-04, 12:30 PM IST - Fix

- **Developer**: Manvatar Prabhu Ji
- **What changed**: Marks are now worked out only from the marking scheme that applies to the student (their sub-group's scheme, else their group's scheme). Before, the student's custom scheme and the default scheme were mixed and the HIGHEST matching mark won, so a custom scheme that gave fewer marks than the default was ignored. The default scheme is still used as a fallback only when the custom scheme has no rules at all for that activity. Applies when a student logs sadhana in the app and when it is logged through WhatsApp.
- **Files touched**: `SadhanaGPT/Student/Controllers/StudentController.js`, `CHANGELOG.md`
- **Frontend**: no change needed. No database structure change. Marks already saved for past/today's entries are not changed by this fix (they only recalculate when the activity is saved again).

## 2026-10-04, 10:50 AM IST - Fix

- **Developer**: Manvatar Prabhu Ji
- **What changed**: Built-in activities (like chanting) are no longer always shown as "already added" on the counsellor Custom Activities screen. They now count as added only while at least one student in the selected group (or sub-group) really has them. After a counsellor removes one, it moves to "Available" (also after a page reload) and can be assigned again. A group with no students keeps built-ins as added. Custom activities work as before.
- **Files touched**: `SadhanaGPT/Controllers/custom activities/AssingActvtiesController.js`, `CHANGELOG.md`
- **Frontend**: no change needed (the matching frontend commit adds a red "+" chip right after removal). No database structure change.

## 2026-10-04, 09:40 AM IST - Fix

- **Developer**: Manvatar Prabhu Ji
- **What changed**: Fixed removing a custom activity from a group when "All Subgroups" is selected. Before, only the group-wide record was deleted, so activities that had earlier been added to specific sub-groups were removed from the students' screens but stayed listed as "already added" and never came back to "Available". Now, with no sub-group chosen, every sub-group's record for that group and activity is removed. Removing from one specific sub-group works as before. Same fix applied to the "remove several activities from group" route.
- **Files touched**: `SadhanaGPT/Controllers/custom activities/AssingActvtiesController.js`, `CHANGELOG.md`
- **Frontend**: no change needed. No database structure change.
